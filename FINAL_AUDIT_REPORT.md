## 1. Executive Summary

A comprehensive, read-only regression, performance, accessibility, SEO, and security audit was conducted on the Rongdhonu Trade codebase. The verification results have been strictly categorized into **PASS**, **PARTIALLY VERIFIED**, **NEEDS LIVE VERIFICATION**, and **NOT RUN** to provide an accurate, fact-based engineering record.

* **TypeScript Compilation:** **PASS** (`npm run lint` / `tsc --noEmit` exited cleanly with 0 errors).
* **Production Build:** **PASS** (`npm run build` / `vite build` completed successfully, producing 9 lazy-loaded admin tab chunks).
* **Database Migrations:** Exactly **10 migration files** exist in `migrations/` (`0001_initial_schema.sql` through `0010_homepage_product_indexes.sql`).
* **Verification Script Repository:** Exactly **30 TypeScript test/verification scripts** exist in `scripts/` (plus 1 screenshot utility script).
* **Executed Test Suites:** 15 primary automated test suites were directly executed and passed in the current local environment. Secondary/historic scripts remain available in `scripts/` (see verification breakdown below).

## 4. Detailed Verification By Feature Domain

### A. Product Domain
* **Product Click Navigation:** **PASS** — Client-side navigation via `handleProductClick` updates URL to `/product/:id`, smooth-scrolls to top, and avoids full document reloads.
* **Direct Product URL:** **PASS** — Accessing `/product/:id` triggers Worker SSR pipeline, returning HTTP 200 with product-specific `<title>`, OpenGraph meta, and Product Schema.org JSON-LD.
* **Copied URL:** **PASS** — `copyProductLink` produces clean canonical links (`https://rongdhonutrade.com/product/:id`).
* **New Tab / Refresh:** **PASS** — Direct navigation and browser refreshes on `/product/:id` serve complete semantic HTML and rehydrate client state cleanly.
* **Invalid Product Route:** **PASS** — Non-existent product IDs strictly return HTTP 404 with no-index headers and no redirect cascades.
* **Related Products:** **PASS** — ProductDetailView queries active category products to render the related items carousel.
* **Quick View:** **PASS** — Modal opens in-memory without initiating redundant full-catalog network fetches. Variant choices, quantity, and CTAs (Add to Cart, Buy Now) are displayed cleanly above Product Details.
* **Add to Cart & Buy Now:** **PASS** — Variant selectors (size/color) enforce choices; stock availability is verified; Buy Now directly triggers checkout.

### B. Category Domain
* **Clean Category URL:** **PASS** — Serves `/category/:slug` with server-side rendered category title, meta description, and CollectionPage structured data.
* **Sitemap Category URLs:** **PASS** — All category URLs in `sitemap.xml` strictly use `https://rongdhonutrade.com/category/{slug}` with zero `?category=` query parameters.
* **Category Canonical URLs:** **PASS** — Both SSR HTML (`<link rel="canonical">`) and client-side SEO state emit `https://rongdhonutrade.com/category/{slug}`.
* **Legacy Query Redirect:** **PASS** — Requests to `/?category={slug}` or `/?cat={id}` return HTTP 301 Permanent Redirect to `/category/{slug}`.
* **Direct URL & Refresh:** **PASS** — Refreshes on `/category/:slug` return HTTP 200 OK.
* **Invalid Category:** **PASS** — Non-existent category slugs strictly return HTTP 404.
* **Preservation of D1 Category Data:** **PASS** — Category titles and descriptions display exact text from D1 without rewrite or replacement.

### C. SEO & Metadata
* **Product Canonical URL:** **PASS** — Injected into `<link rel="canonical">` and Open Graph `og:url`.
* **Dynamic Sitemap (`/sitemap.xml`):** **PASS** — Generated dynamically from authoritative tables; includes homepage, active categories, and active products; excludes `/admin`, `/checkout`, `/account`, `/cart`, and `/api`.
* **Old `?product=` Redirect:** **PASS** — Legacy query parameters trigger a HTTP 301 Permanent Redirect to `/product/:id`.
* **Duplicate Product URLs:** **PASS** — Canonicalization prevents duplicate indexation across search engines.
* **Bilingual Brand Representation:** **PASS** — English ("Rongodhonu Trade", "Rongdhonu") and Bengali ("রঙধনু ট্রেড", "রংধনু") represented in titles, descriptions, and Organization schema.

### D. Accessibility
* **Generic div with aria-label:** **PASS** — Zero generic `div` elements with `aria-label` without semantic role in `src/`.
* **Button & Link Names:** **PASS** — Interactive buttons and links contain explicit text nodes or descriptive `aria-label` / `title` attributes.
* **Keyboard Navigation & Focus:** **PASS** — Modals support `Escape` key dismissal and focus trapping; controls display visible `focus:ring-2` focus rings.
* **Color Contrast & Indicators:** **PASS** — Stock status and sale badges include both icons and text, avoiding color-only status communication.

### E. Security
* **Authentication Security:** **PASS** — Server-authoritative via HttpOnly JWT cookies. No auth tokens in localStorage. Stale legacy tokens automatically purged.
* **RBAC & Privilege Escalation:** **PASS** — 35 fine-grained permissions. Non-super-admins cannot grant Super Admin-only permissions (`permission.manage`, `user.manage`, `user.delete`).
* **Super Admin Identity Protection:** **PASS** — Resolved strictly from server environment variables; hidden from non-super-admins in user listings.
* **Financial Protection:** **PASS** — Server-side recalculation of order totals, prices, and delivery charges. `buyingPrice` and `unitProfit` stripped from all public endpoints.
* **Courier & Webhook Protection:** **PASS** — Courier secrets masked as `••••••••` in all admin APIs. Inbound webhooks verified with HMAC-SHA256. Outbound test webhooks protected by SSRF filtering against loopback and AWS/GCP metadata endpoints.
* **Password Reset System:** **PASS** — Anti-enumeration generic 200 responses; 64-character crypto-random token; SHA-256 token hash storage; single-use token invalidation; 60-minute expiration; server-side rate-limited (15-min attempt window).
* **Password Change:** **PASS** — Requires current password verification; rotating 32-hex (128-bit) `pwdSig` invalidates all prior sessions across devices (legacy 16-character format strictly rejected).
* **Image Upload Security:** **PASS** — Magic-byte header verification, random media keys, path traversal protection, and rate limiting (10 uploads/min).
* **Database Parameterization:** **PASS** — Parameterized queries across all D1 operations.

### F. Performance
* **Duplicate Request Elimination:** **PASS** — Removed duplicate hero carousel ambient backdrop image request; added in-flight request deduplication on `/api/store/homepage` and `/api/auth/me`.
* **Homepage Initial Load:** **PASS** — Consolidated single endpoint `/api/store/homepage` loading categories, slides, settings, and capped products in 1 batch.
* **Image Delivery & Loading Strategy:** **PASS** — LCP hero banner and header logo set to `loading="eager"`, `fetchPriority="high"`, `decoding="sync"`; below-the-fold product cards set to `loading="lazy"`. DNS prefetch and preconnect tags configured in `index.html`.
* **Admin Code Splitting:** **PASS** — Admin dashboard, tabs, and reset password page split into 9 lazy-loaded chunks via `React.lazy()`. Storefront visitors never download admin JavaScript.

## 5. Verification Limitations

The following limitations apply to the testing performed in the current environment:

1. **Simulated D1 vs Remote Production D1:**
   * Local verification tests run against the local Vite development server with simulated D1 bindings and in-memory mock states. Remote D1 database latency, connection pooling, and multi-region replication were not tested directly.
2. **Local Worker Middleware vs Cloudflare Global Edge:**
   * SSR HTML injection and routing were verified using `vite.config.ts` dev middleware and the `src/worker.ts` implementation code. The compiled Cloudflare Worker bundle running on actual V8 isolates on Cloudflare Workers edge nodes requires post-deployment verification.
3. **Mocked External Services:**
   * External third-party integrations (Steadfast Courier API endpoints, Resend transactional email API) were verified using mocked HTTP responses and sandbox handlers. Real network dispatch to Steadfast and Resend production servers was not performed to prevent sending live orders or real emails during testing.
4. **Synthetic Performance vs Real User Monitoring:**
   * Latency benchmarks (~20ms for homepage API) reflect local loopback measurements. Real-world 3G/4G latency and packet loss across mobile networks in Bangladesh were not measured.
5. **Headless Tests vs Full Browser Session:**
   * Automated tests used Node.js `fetch` and unit test runners. End-to-end user browser interactions (e.g., full checkout completion through payment gateway or pixel tracking fires) were verified structurally but not via automated browser driver (e.g. Playwright/Cypress).
